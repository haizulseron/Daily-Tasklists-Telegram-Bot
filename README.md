# Using pyTelegramBotAPI**

Personally, I always needed reminders when it comes to my daily tasks and I need to have a routine set of tasks to complete each day. I created this telegram bot in order to send reminders daily as well as set your daily tasks or custom tasks for that day.

This is so you can deploy this bot on your own using your own BOT from BOT_Father.

Was created using pyTelegramBotAPI (https://pypi.org/project/pyTelegramBotAPI/)
